# CSE3140 - Summative Project - Ship, Captain and Crew!
#### A Digital version of the dice game Ship, Captain and Crew

Ye be on a quest fer booty! procure a ship, find a cap'n, 'n assemble a crew. 'Tis off t' th' sea t' find booty!

## Game Rules

Find ye booty!
T' find yer booty, use yer dice t' commision yer party. Yer diviner's dice consists o' 5 dice. Be sure t' follow me rules: 

1. The ship must be found first
2. The Captain is then commissioned next
3. The Captain will then approve the crew
4. When the ship, Captain and crew are assembled, they can look for loot!
5. Gold is worth 2* dice values

Each player has up to three rolls of the five dice to find loot. Once the ship, Captain, and crew are found, the final two dice represent the loot they find. If the player cannot find all needed members by the end of the three rolls, they score no points. To assemble the pieces, the player must roll the correct numbers: 6 - ship, 5 - Captain, and 4 - crew. Any example of a player’s turn is below:

Roll 1:
    1, 3, 3, 4, 6 → Ship is found! (6 is held)

Roll 2:
    4, 4, 5, 1, 6 → Captain is found! Crew is found! (5 and 4 is held)
	Loot: 10 gold coins! Keep coins? Y/n → N

Roll 3:
    4, 2, 5, 2, 6 
	Loot: 8 gold coins! Player scores 4 points!

#Reflection

Ship Captain and Crew used classes from Farkel, mainly class Dice and Player. Class Dice was used unmodified, while class Player was modified to fit Ship, Captain and Crew.

Ship, Captain and Crew used many aspects that were similar to Farkel, which made it much easier to visualize and implement. Aspects such as dice, and how to hold them were gone over in class which made understanding Ship Captain and Crew much easier, and easier to code. 

I should probably start with planning my code before starting, as I created my flowchart and UML tables after I finished coding Ship, Captain and Crew.
